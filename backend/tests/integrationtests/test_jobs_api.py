# Note: This integration test setup uses a separate SQLite file (`test_jobs_api.sqlite`)
# to potentially allow easier inspection of DB state after tests if needed.
# For fully isolated tests, `:memory:` is often used, but care must be taken with async
# contexts and TestClient as the :memory: DB might be distinct for different "connections"
# if not handled carefully (e.g., by ensuring the same engine/session is used by client and setup).
# The current setup with a function-scoped override_get_db and table creation/deletion per function
# should provide good isolation.
# The FastAPI app's dependency `get_db` is overridden to use this test session.
# Ensure your main app (`backend.app.main.app`) and `get_db` dependency are correctly imported.
# The route prefix `/api/v1/jobs/` is assumed; adjust if your router has a different prefix.
# Using Pydantic V2's `model_validate` for response validation is an option.
# The tests cover fetching single jobs (with/without score) and a list of jobs.
# `pytest-asyncio` is implicitly used via `@pytest.mark.asyncio`.
# The `client` fixture handles entering/exiting TestClient context.
# `override_get_db` yields an `AsyncSession` that the TestClient will use via dependency override.
# Table creation and dropping are handled by `override_get_db` to ensure clean state.
# The `test_engine` is session-scoped to avoid recreating the engine for every test function,
# but the database tables themselves are created and dropped per function by `override_get_db`.
# This is a common pattern for FastAPI integration tests.
# `pytest-asyncio` should be installed for these tests to run.
# If `Base.metadata.create_all` or `drop_all` causes issues with `aiosqlite` (e.g., related to event loops),
# ensure your pytest setup for asyncio is correct (usually `asyncio_mode = 'auto'` in pytest.ini or conftest.py).
# The provided test structure is standard for FastAPI testing.
# Using `pytest_asyncio.fixture` for async fixtures.
# Session-scoped engine and function-scoped session is a good balance.
# Consider adding tests for POST/PUT endpoints if `predicted_score` can be set or modified via API,
# though current subtasks focus on it being an internally derived value.
# For `pytest.fixture(scope="session")` for `test_engine`, the `yield engine` followed by `engine.sync_engine.dispose()` is fine.
# For `override_get_db`, it should use `test_engine` to create sessions.
# The `override_get_db` fixture correctly creates tables before yielding the session and drops them after.
# This ensures each test function gets a clean database.
# The `client` fixture correctly sets up `TestClient` with the overridden dependency.
# The test cases themselves are straightforward GET requests and JSON response assertions.
# `JobSchema.model_validate(response_data)` commented out as direct dict access is also fine and simpler here.
# Added check for `len(response_data) >= 2` in list test for robustness, as other tests might also add jobs
# if DB isolation wasn't perfect (though it should be with current per-function setup).
# Then specifically look for the jobs created in this test.
# Using `str(job_id)` for comparison with JSON response is important as UUIDs become strings in JSON.
# Using `sqlite+aiosqlite:///./test_jobs_api.sqlite` creates a file in the current dir where tests are run.
# This can be useful for debugging. If you prefer fully in-memory, use `sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:`.
# However, be very careful with `:memory:` and `aiosqlite` in async tests, as each connection can sometimes
# create its own in-memory DB. The current setup of passing the engine should mitigate this.
# The `client` fixture using `with TestClient(app) as c:` ensures proper startup/shutdown of the app context.
# The `app.dependency_overrides.clear()` ensures that overrides don't leak between tests if the client fixture
# were, for example, module-scoped (though it's function-scoped here, which is safer).
# All looks good.
