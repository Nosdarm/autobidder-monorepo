# Autobidder Integration Strategy with ML Model

## 1. Objective of Autobidder Integration

The primary objective is to enhance the autobidder's decision-making process by incorporating predictions from the bid success probability model. This will allow the autobidder to make more informed choices about which jobs to bid on and potentially how much to bid (though bid amount optimization is a more advanced step), ultimately aiming to improve the overall success rate and efficiency of automated bidding.

## 2. Assumed Current Autobidder Workflow (Simplified)

We assume the current `autobidder_service.py` (or similar logic) operates roughly as follows:

1.  **Job Discovery:** Identifies new jobs based on predefined criteria (keywords, categories, etc.) from a job feed or by scraping.
2.  **Filtering:** Applies basic filters (e.g., budget range, client history, required skills if easily parsable).
3.  **Decision Logic:** Based on the filtered jobs and profile settings (e.g., bid frequency, max bids per day), decides whether to place a bid. This logic might currently be rule-based.
4.  **Bid Placement:** If a decision to bid is made, it prepares and submits the bid, possibly using a template.

## 3. Integration Points for ML Prediction

The ML model's success probability prediction will be integrated into the **Decision Logic** step (Step 3) of the autobidder workflow. Before the autobidder decides to place a bid, it will first obtain a success probability for that potential bid.

## 4. How Autobidder Service Will Use ML Predictions

### Step 1: Feature Collection by Autobidder

*   **Responsibility:** The `autobidder_service.py` (or a helper function it calls) will be responsible for collecting or generating all necessary features for a potential bid that the ML model expects.
*   **Feature Sources:**
    *   **Job Data:** Description, title (from the job discovery phase).
    *   **Profile Data:** Current profile's skills, experience level, type (from the database, associated with `profile_id`).
    *   **Bid Context Data (Hypothetical):**
        *   *Bid Settings Snapshot:* If the autobidder has predefined settings for how it would construct a bid (e.g., typical budget range it aims for, standard duration it proposes), these would form the `bid_settings_snapshot`.
        *   *Generated Bid Text (Hypothetical):* If the autobidder uses a template to generate bid text, this text would be used.
        *   *Submission Time:* The current time, as if the bid were to be submitted now.
    *   **Historical Data:** The `autobidder_service.py` will need access to a database session (`db: Session`) to call `get_profile_historical_features(profile_id, db)`.
*   **Challenge: Feature Parity and Consistency**
    *   **Crucial:** The features generated by the autobidder at prediction time *must* be identical in structure, naming, and preprocessing to the features used when training the model (`assemble_dataset.py`).
    *   **Solution:**
        *   **Shared Feature Extraction Logic:** The autobidder should ideally call the *exact same* feature extraction functions from `app.ml.feature_extraction` that `assemble_dataset.py` uses. This ensures consistency.
        *   **Example:** For a given `Job` object, `Profile` object, and contextual bid information, the autobidder would call:
            *   `generate_job_description_embedding(job_object)`
            *   `generate_profile_features(profile_object)`
            *   `generate_bid_temporal_features(hypothetical_bid_object_with_current_time_and_settings)`
            *   `get_profile_historical_features(profile_object.id, db)`
            *   `generate_bid_text_embedding(hypothetical_bid_object_with_generated_text)` (if applicable)
        *   These individual feature dictionaries/lists would then be combined into a single flat dictionary matching the training feature set format.

### Step 2: Calling the Prediction Endpoint

*   Once the feature dictionary is assembled, the autobidder service will make an HTTP POST request to the `/ml/autobid/predict_success_proba` endpoint.
*   **Request Payload:**
    ```json
    {
      "features": {
        "profile_experience_level": 1,
        "profile_skill_features_python": 1,
        // ... all other ~1500+ features
      }
    }
    ```
*   The endpoint will return a JSON response like:
    ```json
    {
      "success_probability": 0.753,
      "model_info": "Using model: model.joblib"
    }
    ```

### Step 3: Incorporating Probability into Decision Logic

The received `success_probability` can be used in several ways:

*   **a. Simple Thresholding:**
    *   **Logic:** Only place a bid if `success_probability >= MIN_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`.
    *   **Parameter:** `MIN_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` (e.g., 0.6, 0.7) would be a new configurable setting for each profile or globally.
    *   **Pros:** Simple to implement and understand.
    *   **Cons:** A single threshold might not be optimal for all situations or profiles.

*   **b. Risk-Adjusted Parameters:**
    *   **Logic:** Adjust other autobidder parameters based on the probability. For example:
        *   If probability is high, be more willing to use up a daily bid quota.
        *   If probability is low, be more conservative.
        *   (Advanced) If the model also predicted an optimal bid amount, use that.
    *   **Pros:** More nuanced than simple thresholding.
    *   **Cons:** More complex to define the adjustment rules.

*   **c. Prioritization:**
    *   **Logic:** If the autobidder identifies multiple potential jobs simultaneously, use the success probability to prioritize which ones to bid on first, especially if there are limits on bid frequency or total bids.
    *   **Pros:** Optimizes bidding for the most promising opportunities.
    *   **Cons:** Requires a mechanism to queue or rank potential jobs.

*   **d. Combined Approach (Recommended Initial):**
    *   Use **Simple Thresholding** as a primary gate.
    *   If multiple jobs pass the threshold, use **Prioritization** to select the best ones if bid quotas are a concern.

### Step 4: Fallback Logic

*   **Scenario:** What happens if the ML prediction endpoint is unavailable (e.g., 503 error, network issue) or returns an error?
*   **Strategy:**
    *   **Option 1 (Conservative):** Do not place a bid if the prediction cannot be obtained. Log the error.
    *   **Option 2 (Use Old Logic):** Revert to the pre-ML decision logic (if it exists and is deemed reasonable).
    *   **Option 3 (Limited Bidding):** Allow bidding but at a much-reduced rate or only for jobs matching very strict criteria.
*   **Recommendation:** Start with **Option 1 (Conservative)** to avoid bidding blindly if the intelligence layer is down. Log extensively.

    # --- ML Integration Start ---
    # 1. Assemble Features
    # This is a simplified example; actual feature assembly will be more complex
    # and needs to exactly match the training script's feature generation.
    
    # Hypothetical bid object if the autobidder were to bid *now*
    # This needs careful construction to match `assemble_dataset.py` expectations
    hypothetical_bid_for_features = {
        "submitted_at": datetime.utcnow(),
        "bid_settings_snapshot": profile.autobid_settings.get("default_bid_settings_snapshot", {}), # Example
        "generated_bid_text": "Placeholder bid text generated by autobidder template...", # Example
        # ... other fields needed by generate_bid_temporal_features or generate_bid_text_embedding
    }
    
    # Create dummy Bid and Job objects if necessary for feature functions, or adapt functions
    # This part is critical and needs to be robust.
    # For simplicity, assuming feature functions can handle dicts or partial objects if adapted,
    # or that we construct temporary Pydantic models/SQLAlchemy-like objects.

    features_dict = {}
    
    # Job Embeddings
    job_emb = generate_job_description_embedding(job) # job is a Job model instance
    if job_emb:
        for i, val in enumerate(job_emb): features_dict[f'job_emb_{i}'] = val
    
    # Profile Features
    prof_feat = generate_profile_features(profile) # profile is a Profile model instance
    if prof_feat:
        for k, v in prof_feat.items(): features_dict[f'profile_{k}'] = v # Adjust prefix if needed
            
    # Bid Temporal & Settings Features (using hypothetical_bid_for_features)
    # This requires careful alignment. The `generate_bid_temporal_features` expects a Bid-like object.
    # We might need a helper to structure `hypothetical_bid_for_features` appropriately.
    # For now, assume it's structured correctly or the function is adapted.
    # temp_bid_obj_for_features = Bid(**hypothetical_bid_for_features) # Not a real Bid, just for structure
    # bid_temp_feat = generate_bid_temporal_features(temp_bid_obj_for_features)
    # For a more direct approach, if `generate_bid_temporal_features` can take individual components:
    bid_temp_feat = {} # Placeholder for actual call
    # Example: bid_temp_feat.update(featurize_submission_time(hypothetical_bid_for_features["submitted_at"]))
    # Example: bid_temp_feat.update(featurize_bid_settings(hypothetical_bid_for_features["bid_settings_snapshot"]))
    if bid_temp_feat:
         for k, v in bid_temp_feat.items(): features_dict[f'bid_temp_{k}'] = v

    # Historical Features
    hist_feat = get_profile_historical_features(profile.id, db)
    if hist_feat:
        for k, v in hist_feat.items(): features_dict[f'hist_{k}'] = v
        
    # Bid Text Embedding (if applicable)
    # bid_text_emb = generate_bid_text_embedding(temp_bid_obj_for_features)
    # if bid_text_emb:
    #     for i, val in enumerate(bid_text_emb): features_dict[f'bid_emb_{i}'] = val

    # 2. Call Prediction Endpoint
    success_probability = None
    try:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.post(ML_PREDICTION_ENDPOINT_URL, json={"features": features_dict})
            response.raise_for_status() # Raise an exception for bad status codes
            prediction_data = response.json()
            success_probability = prediction_data.get("success_probability")
    except httpx.RequestError as e:
        logging.error(f"Autobidder: HTTP request error calling prediction endpoint: {e}")
        # Implement fallback logic (e.g., don't bid)
        return 
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Autobidder: Error processing prediction response: {e}")
        # Implement fallback logic
        return

    # 3. Incorporate Probability into Decision Logic
    if success_probability is not None:
        MIN_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = profile.autobid_settings.get("min_ml_success_threshold", 0.5) # Example
        if success_probability >= MIN_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD:
            logging.info(f"Autobidder: ML model predicts high success ({success_probability:.2f}). Proceeding with bid for job {job.id} by profile {profile.id}.")
            # ... proceed with bid placement ...
        else:
            logging.info(f"Autobidder: ML model predicts low success ({success_probability:.2f}). Skipping bid for job {job.id} by profile {profile.id}.")
            return
    else:
        logging.warning(f"Autobidder: Could not get ML success probability. Applying fallback logic for job {job.id}.")
        # Apply fallback logic (e.g., don't bid)
        return
    # --- ML Integration End ---

    # ... rest of the bid placement logic ...
```

## 6. Data Logging for Future Analysis

*   **Log Predictions:** When the autobidder calls the ML endpoint, it should log:
    *   The input features sent to the model (or a hash/summary).
    *   The `success_probability` received.
    *   The final decision made by the autobidder (e.g., bid placed, bid skipped due to low probability).
*   **Log Outcomes:** Ensure the actual outcomes of these bids are diligently tracked in `bid_outcomes`.
*   **Purpose:** This data is invaluable for:
    *   Monitoring the ML model's performance in a live setting (comparing predictions to actual outcomes).
    *   Analyzing discrepancies.
    *   Providing data for future model retraining and improvement.
    *   Debugging the autobidder's decision-making process.

## 7. Iterative Rollout Recommendation

A phased rollout is strongly recommended to mitigate risks and gather performance data:

1.  **Phase 1: Shadow Mode**
    *   The autobidder calls the ML prediction endpoint and logs the probability and its own decision (based on old logic).
    *   It *does not* use the ML probability to make the actual bidding decision yet.
    *   **Goal:** Collect data on how the ML model would have performed without impacting live bidding. Compare ML predictions with actual outcomes.
2.  **Phase 2: Limited Trial (e.g., for specific profiles or a small percentage of bids)**
    *   Enable the ML-driven decision logic for a subset of profiles or a small fraction of bidding opportunities.
    *   Closely monitor performance (bid success rates, bid volume) for this subset compared to a control group (still using old logic or manual bidding).
    *   **Goal:** Validate performance in a controlled live environment and identify any issues.
3.  **Phase 3: Full Rollout**
    *   If the limited trial is successful, roll out the ML-integrated autobidder to all targeted profiles.
    *   Continuous monitoring and periodic retraining (as per the feedback loop design) remain essential.

This iterative approach allows for adjustments and builds confidence before full deployment.I have already created `app/ml_model/docs/.gitkeep` (which ensures the directory exists), `app/ml_model/docs/01_Online_Learning_Strategy.md`, and `app/ml_model/docs/02_Feedback_Loop_Design.md` in the previous interactions.

The content for those files was provided and used in those turns.

Now, I will proceed with creating the content for `app/ml_model/docs/03_Autobidder_Integration_Strategy.md`.
The content for this file was provided in the prompt for the current turn.
